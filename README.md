# chipotle-clustering-challenge
becode, team challenge

### Must-have features

- A visualisation of the USA with chipotle locations
- Visualization of the different clusters
- Intrinsic analysis comparison of the clusters of at least 2 methods with varying arguments (using euclidian distance as criteria)
- A chosen centroid to live. Make your argument of why the chosen centroid is superior to others. Examples of arguments are:
    - highest density
    - greatest uninterrupted link of chipotle locations with smallest link-to-link distance
    - ...
- a Github page where results are visualized

## Steps
- [X]  Create the repository
- [ ]  Install geopandas
- [ ]  Plot the US map
- [ ]  Visualize your data on this map
- [ ]  Plot a dendogram of your data to help you decide the appropropriate clustering resolution
- [ ]  Compare and analyse different clustering methods using intrinsic analysis to decide on a chosen method.
- [ ]  Choose a centroid/adress to live
- [ ]  Publish your results to a Github page with an explanation of your method.
